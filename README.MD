# Hybrid Log Classification for Banking Portal

This project implements a **Hybrid Log Classification** system to classify the severity of logs generated by a banking
portal. It leverages a combination of rule-based, machine learning (ML), and large language model (LLM)-based
classification techniques to ensure robust and accurate severity classification of logs.

## Features

1. **Regex Classifier**:  
   A rule-based approach that uses predefined regular expressions to identify patterns in logs and classify their
   severity. This classifier is highly efficient for consistent patterns like error codes, specific keywords, or
   well-defined log formats.

2. **ML Model Classifier**:  
   A machine learning-based classifier trained on historical log data to predict severity levels. This approach is
   highly
   effective for structured log data to make
   accurate predictions.

3. **LLM Classifier**:  
   Cutting-edge classification powered by large language models (LLMs), providing flexibility and enhanced accuracy in
   unstructured or unseen log data. This classifier leverages advanced natural language understanding to handle complex
   patterns and subtle log contexts, integrating seamlessly with the system through APIs such as:


## Hybrid Approach

The hybrid architecture enables the system to combine the strengths of different methods:

- **Regex Classifier**: Best for deterministic log patterns where severity can be pre-defined.
- **ML Model Classifier**: Suitable for handling structured data with historical training.
- **LLM Classifier**: Effective for complex, poorly structured, or unseen logs requiring natural language understanding.

A decision module is employed to determine the appropriate classifier to use for each log entry, based on pre-defined
thresholds or configurations.
